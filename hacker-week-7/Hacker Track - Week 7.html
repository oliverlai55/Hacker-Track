//a) Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


	//Place your code here.
	var sequence = function(){
		var a = 0;
		var b = 1;
		var c;
		var sum = 0;
		for (var i = 2; i <= 100; i++){
			c = a + b;
			a = b;
			b = c;
			if(b % 2 === 0 && b < 4000000){
				sum = sum + b
			}
		}
		return sum; 
	}

sequence();
